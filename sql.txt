1 lb. broccoli
1 med. yellow onion, peeled & sliced
2 tbsp. butter
1 Quiche Crust (recipe follows)
4 eggs, beaten
3/4 c. cream
1 1/4 c. milk
Salt & pepper to taste
1/2 lb. Swiss cheese, grated into coarse pieces

Clean the broccoli and cut into flowerets. Saute the onion and broccoli in butter until tender but not soft. Place the vegetables in the bottom of the quiche crust. Mix the eggs, cream, milk, salt and pepper. Fill the shell and top with the Swiss cheese. Bake at 375 degrees for 30 to 40 minutes or until a knife inserted in the center of the quiche comes out dry. Cool for 10 minutes before cutting. Can be served at room temperature.

QUICHE CRUST:

2 c. flour
2 tsp. baking powder
Salt (opt.)
1/2 c. vegetable oil
1/4 c. milk

Mix the flour and the baking powder together. Add salt if desired. Mix the oil and milk together and then pour into the flour. Stir only until mixed. The mixture will be rather coarse and granular, but it will roll out well. Do not over-mix. Mold into 2 balls and wrap in plastic. Allow to sit for 15 minutes. Each ball will make 1 (9 inch) pie crust.
If you are using a larger French quiche pan, then use a bit more of the dough. Roll out between two sheets of waxed paper. Place the pastry in the quiche pan or pie plate and prick the bottom with a kitchen fork. Line the inside with waxed paper or aluminum foil. Put two cups of dry beans into the pie crust and bake at 400 degrees for 12 minutes. Save the beans for the next pie crust you make. The shell is now ready for filling and baking. Makes 2 (9 inch) pie crusts or 1 larger crust.

Cut the chicken thighs into bite-sized pieces and transfer them to a 3-quart or larger slow cooker. Stir in the onion, garlic, ginger, tomato paste, 1 tablespoon of garam masala, paprika, and kosher salt until the chicken is evenly covered with spices. Stir in the diced tomatoes with their juices.
? If you have the time: Marinate the chicken in 1/2 cup yogurt for up to 6 hours. Shake to remove excess yogurt before transferring to the slow cooker.

Transfer to the slow cooker with the chicken and diced tomatoes. This will give your tikka masala more depth of flavor.
Cover the slow cooker and cook for 4 hours on high or 8 hours on low. Fifteen minutes before the end of cooking, stir in the heavy cream. If you prefer a thicker sauce, leave the slow cooker uncovered for the last 15 minutes. Taste and add more garam masala or salt to taste.

Directions
At least 1 day before you plan to make the fried rice, place the rinsed rice in a heavy, medium-sized saucepan. Add 2 cups of cold water and salt, to taste. Bring to a boil over high heat. Cover, and cook at a gentle boil until the water has cooked down to the level of the rice. With a spoon (not a fork), stir the rice well. Cover, and reduce the heat to low. Continue to cook for about 15 minutes, or until the rice is tender. Fluff with a fork. Cool to room temperature before covering and refrigerating for 24 hours.
Break up any clumps of the cold rice with your fingers and set aside. In a small bowl, stir together the oyster sauce and soy sauce and set aside.
Coat a large, nonstick skillet with nonstick vegetable spray and set over medium-high heat. When the skillet is hot, add the eggs, swirling them around to make sure they coat the whole bottom of the pan. Cook, without stirring, and adjusting the heat as necessary, until the eggs are firm and cooked through but not yet starting to brown, lifting the skillet and tilting it so that the eggs cook evenly. Slide the eggs onto a plate and when they have cooled, cut into small pieces and set aside.
Return the skillet to the burner and heat the oil over high heat. When it is hot, add the peas and scallions, and cook, stirring constantly, until the scallions are limp, about 1 minute. Stir in the rice, sauce mixture, eggs and roast pork until well mixed. Continue to cook, stirring, until the rice is heated through, 1 to 2 minutes. Plate and drizzle with sesame oil, to taste.

Combine the eggs, milk, salt, and pepper in a medium bowl and mix very well with a fork or a whisk.
Set a plate by the stove. Heat a small (about 6 inches) seasoned omelet pan or non-stick skillet over medium-high heat. When the pan is warm, add the butter (it should sizzle gently). Swirl the pan to distribute the butter as it melts. When the butter stops sizzling and the foam subsides add the eggs. Pause to let the eggs heat slightly and then stir vigorously, with a heatproof spatula, making sure you include the sides of the egg mixture occasionally so the omelet cooks evenly. Once the eggs are just set, bang the pan gently on the burner to release the omelet from the pan. Check to see that it is not sticking to the sides or bottom of the pan, if so release the omelet with a heat proof spatula. Hold the pan at a 45-degree angle to the stove and carefully fold the omelet like a business letter. Cook just until the desired degree of doneness lifting the pan or reducing the heat to prevent browning. (A classic omelet doesn't have any browning on it.) Transfer to a warm plate and serve.
Omelet Filling Suggestions: There are many omelet fillings, both raw and cooked, sweet and savory. Here is a starting point, but feel free to improvise. Once the eggs are set add any of these ingredients before folding. An alternative method, to use with delicate fillings, like creme fraiche and herbs, fresh fruits or caviar
- 1 tablespoon finely chopped fresh herbs, like Italian parsley, basil, dill, tarragon, chives, thyme, and chervil. Use the herbs alone or in combination, like the classic combination fine herbs (equal parts parsley, chervil, chives and tarragon.) Brush the finished omelet with butter and sprinkle with additional herbs. Herbs can also be added to the omelet mixture to flavor the eggs more fully. - 2 to 3 tablespoons cooked vegetables like, chopped asparagus, spinach or other greens, zucchini, mushrooms, eggplant or peppers - 2 tablespoons diced fresh tomato or avocado - 2 tablespoons grated cheese, like Gruyere, Goat cheese, Cheddar, Monterey Jack, Gouda, Feta - 1 tablespoon currant jelly, then dust omelet with confectioner's sugar - 2 tablespoons chopped proscuitto or other ham, crumbled cooked bacon or other cured meat - 1 to 2 tablespoons chopped smoked salmon or trout, with a tablespoon sour cream, cream cheese or creme fraiche - 1 tablespoon honey with 1 tablespoon ricotta cheese - 2 to 3 tablespoons sliced apples, pears or strawberries, alone or with a complimentary cheese.
